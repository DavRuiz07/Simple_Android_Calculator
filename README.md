# Simple_Android_Calculator
A simple calculator that has number keys, operations, a clear button and a negative operator. Learned Quite a bit building this app.

This app may not be an eye catcher but it functions as a calculator that works and changes based on its orientation (portrait or landscape)

This application was quite the interesting build. For someone who has been gaining more and more intrigue in mobile development, 
this is certainly a proving point for my self. Since this is my first Android app, learning the different methods and tools Android Studio
had to offer was by far the exciting part of the process.
